  abstract = {Fisheries science is concerned with the management and understanding of the raising and harvesting of fish. Fish stocks are assessed using biological and fisheries data with the goal of estimating either their total population or biomass. Stock assessment models also make it possible to predict how stocks will respond to varying levels of fishing pressure in the future. Such tools are essential with overfishing now reducing stocks and employment worldwide, with in turn many serious social, economic, and environmental implications. Increasingly, a state-space framework is being used in place of deterministic and standard parametric stock assessment models. These efforts have not only had considerable impact on fisheries management but have also advanced the supporting statistical theory and inference tools as well as the required software. An application of such techniques to the North Sea cod stock highlights what should be considered best practices for sciencebased fisheries management.},

  abstract = {Data used in stock assessment models result from combinations of biological, ecological, fishery, and sampling processes. Since different types of errors propagate through these processes, it can be difficult to identify a particular family of distributions for modelling errors on observations a priori. By implementing several observational likelihoods, modelling both numbers- and proportions-at-age, in an age-based state-space stock assessment model, we compare the model fit for each choice of likelihood along with the implications for spawning stock biomass and mean fishing mortality. We propose using AIC intervals based on fitting the full observational model for comparing different observational likelihoods. Using data from four stocks, we show that the model fit is improved by modelling the correlation of observations within years. However, the best choice of observational likelihood differs for different stocks, and the choice is important for the short-term conclusions drawn from the assessment model; in particular, the choice can influence total allowable catch advise based on reference points.},

This way observed data are linked to unobserved quantities in the population model. Using this framework, we suggest two modifications to improve accuracy in results obtained from the stock assessment model SAM and similar models. The first suggestion is to interpret the ``process error'' in these models as stochastic variation in natural mortality, and therefore include it in the data model. The second suggestion is to consider the observed catch as unbiased estimates of the true catch and modify the observation error accordingly. We demonstrate the efficacy of these modifications using empirical data from 14 fish stocks. Our results indicate that the modifications lead to improved fits to data and prediction performance, as well as reduced prediction bias.},

We tested each projection specification for 12 groundfish stocks in the Northwest Atlantic to identify sources of bias and evaluate techniques for reducing bias. Projections were made from assessments using virtual population analysis (VPA) with 1\textendash 7 years of recent data removed from the full time series and were then compared with results from a VPA assessment on the full time series of data. The main source of bias in projections was the assessment model estimates of the numbers at age in the terminal model year + 1 (Na,T+1). Recruitment was responsible for more bias in projections beyond 3 years, when population numbers begin to be dominated by cohorts that were statistically generated. Retrospective analysis was performed and several adjustment factors to reduce bias were tested. Even after adjusting for bias, the remaining bias in projections was non-negligible. The direction of bias generally resulted in projected spawning stock biomass (SSB) and catch being overestimated, and the bias in catch was nearly always larger than in SSB. Scientists need to clearly communicate the direction and magnitude of this bias, managers need to consider this additional uncertainty when specifying future catch limits, and both scientists and managers need to develop more robust control rules so that objectives are achieved.},

  abstract = {A state-space assessment model for the northern cod (Gadus morhua) stock off southern Labrador and eastern Newfoundland is developed here. The model utilizes information from offshore trawl surveys, inshore acoustic surveys, fishery catch age compositions, partial fishery landings, and tagging. This is done using an approach that avoids the use of subjective data-weighting. Estimates of fishing mortality rates (F) are usually conditional on assumptions about natural mortality rates (M) in stock assessment models. However, by integrating much of the information on northern cod, it is possible to estimate F and M separately. It is also possible to estimate a change in the offshore survey catchability by including inshore acoustic biomass estimates. The proposed model also accounts for biased total catch statistics, which is a common problem in stock assessments. The main goal of the model is to provide realistic projections of the impacts of various levels of future fishery catches on the recovery of this stock. The projections incorporate uncertainty about M and catch. This is vital information for successful future fisheries. The model has been developed for the specific data sources available for northern cod, but it could be adapted to other stocks with similar data sources.},

We present simulation results which demonstrate that in small-sample settings, our criterion estimates the expected discrepancy with less bias than traditional AIC and certain other competitors. As a result, our AIC variant serves as an effective tool for selecting a model of appropriate dimension. We present an asymptotic justification for our criterion in the Appendix.},

  abstract = {Environmental indices that provide short-term predictions of recruitment have the potential to improve the average yield from highly productive resources that sustain recruit fisheries without an associated increase in risk (of resource 'collapse'). This is particularly true for cases where a measurement of recruitment is not available until after substantial fishing on this recruitment has already taken place. The South African anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus resource reflects such a situation, and forms the basis for a simulation study to investigate the benefits of using environmental indices to set appropriate Total Allowable Catches (TACs). Simulations, based on a 'management procedure' (sensu the International Whaling Commission), investigate how such benefits are related to the proportion of variation in recruitment explained by the environmental index. Furthermore, they evaluate to what extent these benefits are compromised by uncertainties related to the degrees of freedom effect (over-fitting data), the selection of explanatory variables (danger of spurious correlations), and errors in the values of explanatory variables (including measurement error). Five recruitment prediction models that incorporate increasing numbers of these uncertainties are investigated. These predictions are used to adjust TACs depending on whether they indicate forthcoming recruitment to be in the top or bottom third of the distribution of possible recruitment values. Results indicate that an environmental index needs to explain roughly 50\% or more of the total variation in recruitment (r2 {$\geq$} 0.5) before the management procedure starts showing benefits in terms of the summary performance statistics for risk and average catch. Comparable benefits are possible at a lower r2 value when TAC constraints are removed, but there is then a large associated increase in interannual catch variation. When r2 is low, performance in terms of average catch may prove worse if attempting to take account of an environmental variable in setting the TAC than ignoring it.},

  abstract = {Penalties are widely used for a range of parameters while fitting fish stock assessment models. Penalizing annual recruitments for deviating from an underlying mean recruitment is probably the most common. Assuming that recruits are log-normally distributed for the purposes of this penalty is theoretically justifiable. In practice, however, bias may be induced because this distributional assumption includes a term equal to the summation of the log observed data, which in the case of recruitment equals the summation of the log recruitment parameters that are not data. Using simulation, the potential for bias caused by assuming that recruits were log-normally distributed was explored, and results were contrasted with the assumption that log-recruitment was normally distributed, an alternative that avoids the potentially troublesome summation term. Spawning stock biomass (SSB) and recruitment were negatively biased, while fishing mortality (F) was positively biased under the assumption of log-normally distributed recruitments, and the bias worsened closer to the terminal year. The bias also worsened when the true underlying F was low relative to natural mortality, and with domed fishery selectivity. Bias in SSB, recruitment, and F was nonexistent or relatively small under the assumption that log-recruitment was normally distributed. Distributional assumptions for penalties used in assessment models should be reviewed to reduce the potential for biased estimation. These results also provide further support for simulation testing to evaluate statistical behavior of assessment models.},

The method follows the probability logic of the Kalman filter, but whereas the Kalman filter applies to linear, Gaussian systems, we implement the full probability calculations numerically so that any nonlinear, non-Gaussian model can be used. We refer to the method as the "numerically integrated state-space (NISS) method" and compare it to two common methods used to analyze nonlinear time series in ecology: least squares with only process noise (LSPN) and least squares with only observation error (LSOE). We compare all three methods by fitting Beverton-Holt and Ricker models to many replicate model-generated time series of length 20 with several parameter choices. For the Ricker model we chose parameters for which the deterministic part of the model produces a stable equilibrium, a two-cycle, or a four-cycle. For each set of parameters we used three process-noise and observation-error scenarios: large standard deviation (0.2) for both, and large for one but small (0.05) for the other. The NISS method had lower estimator bias and variance than the other methods in nearly all cases. The only exceptions were for the Ricker model with stable-equilibrium parameters, in which case the LSPN and LSOE methods has lower bias when noise variances most closely met their assumptions. For the Beverton-Holt model, the NISS method was much less biased and more precise than the other methods.},

We used temperature-dependent population models to measure the influence of warming on the productivity of 235 populations of 124 species in 38 ecoregions. Some populations responded significantly positively (n = 9 populations) and others responded significantly negatively (n = 19 populations) to warming, with the direction and magnitude of the response explained by ecoregion, taxonomy, life history, and exploitation history. Hindcasts indicate that the maximum sustainable yield of the evaluated populations decreased by 4.1\% from 1930 to 2010, with five ecoregions experiencing losses of 15 to 35\%.

Management advice ignoring environmental forcing of recruitment may cause stocks to be over- or under-harvested, so it is important to consider including environmental forcing on recruitment in stock assessment models. Simulation testing is used to determine the statistical power of stock assessments to identify long-term, decadal-scale environmental forcing of recruitment and the ability to estimate management reference points when the duration of the fisheries time series is equal to or less than the period of the environmental cycle. Commonly used assessment methods generally lead to lower total type I (incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis of no environmental impact) and type II (failing to detect an environmental impact when such a relationship exists) error rates. The promise of integrating environmental data with decadal-scale variability directly into stock assessments via the stock\textendash recruitment relationship is outweighed by the pitfall of high type I error rates that are due to fishing-induced stock declines that coincide with directional environmental change. However, the impact of type I errors can be minimized by choosing an appropriate combination of assessment method and reference point estimators.},

The only successes identified were for species with a short pre-recruit survival window (e.g., opportunistic life-history strategy), where the abbreviated life-span made it easier to identify one or a limited set of key drivers that directly impact dynamics. Autoregressive methods appeared to perform as well, if not better, for species with a longer pre-recruit survival window (e.g., seasonal, inter-annual) during which the environment could potentially exert influence. This review suggests that the inclusion of environmental drivers into assessments and forecasting is most likely to be successful for species with short pre-recruit survival windows (e.g., squid, sardine) and for those that have bottlenecks in their life history during which the environment can exert a well-defined pressure (e.g., anadromous fishes, those reliant on nursery areas). The effects of environment may be more complicated and variable for species with a longer pre-recruit survival window, reducing the ability to quantify environment-recruitment relationships. Species with more complex early life histories and longer pre-recruit survival windows would benefit from future research that focuses on relevant species-specific spatio-temporal scales to improve mechanistic understanding of abiotic-biotic interactions.},

  abstract = {The relationship between body weight and natural mortality in juvenile and adult fish was analysed for different aquatic ecosystems: lakes, rivers, the ocean, and pond, cage and tank aquaculture systems. Mortality was modelled as a power function of weight, and the parameters b (exponent) and Mu (mortality at the unit weight of 1 g) estimated for fish in the six ecosystems, as well as within selected populations, species and families. At the ecosystem level, no significant differences in parameters were found between lakes, rivers and the ocean and a joint mortality-weight relationship for all natural ecosystems was estimated with parameters b=-0.288 (90\% CL[-0.315, -0.261]) and Mu=3.00 (90\% CL[2.70, 3.30]) year-1. Among the culture systems, mortality-weight relationships in ponds and cages were not significantly different and a joint relationship was estimated. The weight exponents of mortality in ponds/cages and tanks were very similar at about b=-0.43, and significantly more negative than in natural ecosystems. Mortalities at unit weight were significantly lower in tanks (0.91 year-1) than in ponds/cages (2.24 year-1), and both were significantly lower than in natural ecosystems. No systematic differences were found between the mortality-weight relationships determined for individual populations, species or families, and fish in the respective ecosystems. It is hypothesized that aquaculture mortality-weight relationships indicate the allometric scaling of non-predation mortality, which is therefore more strongly size dependent than predation mortality. If non predation mortality in natural ecosystems shows a similar scaling with body weight, then the allometric exponent of predation mortality must be less negative than that observed for total natural mortality. Implications of the established mortality-weight relationships for aquaculture and culture-based fisheries are discussed.},

The framework is highly scalable from data-weak situations where it operates as an age-structured production model, to complex situations where it can flexibly incorporate multiple data sources and account for biological and environmental processes. SS implements compensatory population dynamics through use of a function relating mean recruitment to spawner reproductive output. This function enhances the ability of SS to operate in data-weak situations and enables it to estimate fishery management quantities such as fishing rates that would provide for maximum sustainable yield and to employ these rates in forecasts of potential yield and future stock status. Complex model configurations such as multiple areas and multiple growth morphs are possible, tag-recapture data can be used to aid estimation of movement rates among areas, and most parameters can change over time in response to environmental and ecosystem factors. SS is coded using Auto-Differentiation Model Builder, so inherits its powerful capability to efficiently estimate hundreds of parameters using either maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference. Output processing, principally through a package developed in R, enables rapid model diagnosis. Details of the underlying population dynamics and the statistical framework used within SS are provided.},

We apply the model to southern New England yellowtail flounder (Limanda ferruginea) using data from the most recent benchmark assessment to evaluate evidence for effects of the mid-Atlantic cold pool and spawning stock biomass on recruitment. Based on Akaike's information criterion, both the cold pool and spawning stock biomass were important predictors of recruitment and led to annual variation in estimated biomass reference points and associated yield. We also demonstrate the effect of the stochasticity of the mid-Atlantic cold pool on short-term forecasts of the stock size, biomass reference point, and stock status.},

However, treating natural mortality as known and constant across ages continues to be common practice. We developed a state-space, age-structured assessment model that allowed different assumptions for natural mortality and the degree of temporal stochasticity in abundance. We fit a suite of models where natural mortality was either age-invariant or an allometric function of mass and interannual transitions of abundance were deterministic or stochastic to observations on Gulf of Maine \textendash{} Georges Bank Acadian redfish (Sebastes fasciatus). We found that allowing stochasticity in the interannual transition in abundance was important and estimating age-invariant natural mortality was sufficient. A simulation study showed low bias in annual biomass estimation when the estimation and simulation model matched and the Akaike imformation criterion accurately measured relative model performance, but it was important to allow simulated data sets to include the stochasticity in interannual transitions of abundance-at-age.},

Process variation, which can be both demographic and environmental, is modeled by linking a series of stochastic and deterministic subprocesses that characterize processes such as birth, survival, maturation, and movement. Observations of the population can be modeled as functions of true abundance with realistic probability distributions to describe observation or estimation error. Computer-intensive procedures, such as sequential Monte Carlo methods or Markov chain Monte Carlo, condition on the observed data to yield estimates of both the underlying true population abundances and the unknown population dynamics parameters. Formulation and fitting of a hidden process model are demonstrated for Sacramento River winter-run chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytsha).},

In classical deterministic VPA-type models the fishing mortality rates are unfiltered representations of the observed catches. As a consequence the selectivity becomes time-varying, but this representation is too fluctuating, because it includes the observation noise. In parametric statistical catch at age models a common assumption is that the selectivity is constant in all years, although time-varying selectivity can be introduced by splitting the data period in blocks with different selectivities, or by using smoothing splines and penalized time-deviances. However, these methods require subjective choices w.r.t. the degree of time-varying allowed. A simple state-space assessment model is presented as an alternative, which among other benefits offers an objective way of estimating time-varying selectivity pattern. The fishing mortality rates are considered (possibly correlated) stochastic processes, and the corresponding process variances are estimated within the model. The model is applied to North Sea cod and it is verified from simulations that time-varying selectivity can be estimated.},

  abstract = {Climate can impact fish population dynamics through changes in productivity and shifts in distribution, and both responses have been observed for many fish species. However, few studies have incorporated climate into population dynamics or stock assessment models. This study aimed to uncover how past variations in population vital rates and fishing pressure account for observed abundance variation in summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus). The influences of the Gulf Stream Index, an index of climate variability in the Northwest Atlantic, on abundance were explored through natural mortality and stock\textendash recruitment relationships in age-structured hierarchical Bayesian models. Posterior predictive loss and deviance information criterion indicated that out of tested models, the best estimates of summer flounder abundances resulted from the climatedependent natural mortality model that included log-quadratic responses to the Gulf Stream Index. This climate-linked population model demonstrates the role of climate responses in observed abundance patterns and emphasizes the complexities of environmental effects on populations beyond simple correlations. This approach highlights the importance of modeling the combined effect of fishing and climate simultaneously to understand population dynamics.},

Over the years, many of these impediments have been resolved but not well communicated to stakeholders, managers, scientists, and policymakers. As a result, several past impediments to implementing ecosystem-based fisheries management have taken on a mythical status. Here we identify six common myths, address why they in fact no longer impede ecosystem-based fisheries management, and propose solutions for moving forward.

  abstract = {Several studies have documented fish populations changing in response to long-term warming. Over the past decade, sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Maine increased faster than 99\% of the global ocean. The warming, which was related to a northward shift in the Gulf Stream and to changes in the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation, led to reduced recruitment and increased mortality in the region's Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) stock. Failure to recognize the impact of warming on cod contributed to overfishing. Recovery of this fishery depends on sound management, but the size of the stock depends on future temperature conditions. The experience in the Gulf of Maine highlights the need to incorporate environmental factors into resource management. Double jeopardy In the best of worlds, exploited fish stocks are monitored so that harvest quotas protect the reproductive ability of the population. Climate change is likely to complicate this process substantially. Pershing et al. found that cod stocks declined continuously during intense warming in the North Atlantic. Fisheries quotas, even though they were responsibly set and followed by fishers, decreased the reproductive rate. Thus, managing fisheries in a warming world is going to be increasingly problematic.

  abstract = {Integrated analysis (or integrated population modelling) methods have become the preferred approach for conducting stock assessments, and providing the basis for management advice for fish and invertebrate stocks since the publication of a seminal paper by Fournier and Archibald in 1982. Methods to assess fish stocks based on single-species, single-area, age-structured models are now standard, with the major debates associated with these models related to data choice, model configuration assumptions, and data weighting. However, the current generation of stock assessment packages is not addressing all of the needs of stock assessment analysts and managers. A major challenge for any next-generation stock assessment package is the set of extensions needed to assess stocks that do not satisfy the `well-mixed single-stock' paradigm. In addition, the next-generation stock assessment package needs to: (a) be able to capture age and size/stage dynamics simultaneously yet computationally efficiently, (b) scale from data-rich to data-poor, (c) include some multi-species capability, and (d) more appropriately deal with temporal variation (e.g., random effects and state-space models). In relation to data, there is a need to ensure that the next-generation stock assessment package better handles tagging data (agesize/stage models may help in this regard), in particular, to be able to use close-kin mark-recapture data. Efficient methods are needed to share parameter priors among stocks (satisfying the promise of the `Robin Hood' paradigm). The next-generation stock assessment package needs to have associated appropriate training programs and documentation. Adoption of such a package will be facilitated by a data entry system that is welldocumented, does not require specification of inputs that will not be used in an application, has an expert system to configure default settings based on best practices, and has associated code to automatically produce diagnostic statistics. Some technical challenges that have plagued stock assessment for decades warrant continued attention (at the theoretical and applied level) such as automatic data weighting and tuning, how to handle spatial and stock structure, improved coding to facilitate application of state-of-the-art methods for quantifying uncertainty, and adoption of true state-space formulations to allow more parameters to be treated as random effects. Future needs for features cannot be anticipated, so the key design consideration for the next-generation stock assessment package is to be flexible and modifiable to meet the requirements of analysts and users.},

However, despite imposition of severe catch restrictions for over a decade, stocks have mostly failed to recover at predicted rates. A number of explanations have been considered. Our analysis of demographic characteristics of 12 of these stocks indicates that recent productivity over the northern portion of the range is much lower than 20 years previous when several stocks recovered from less severe declines. Main contributing factors are, in rank order, increased natural mortality, decreased body growth, and in a few cases, reduced recruitment rates. Continued fishing in directed and bycatch fisheries is also an important factor. Under current conditions, we estimate negative or very low ({$<$}2\% per year) average growth rates in eight stocks.

  abstract = {Statistical models play an important role in fisheries science when reconciling ecological theory with available data for wild populations or experimental studies. Ecological models increasingly include both fixed and random effects, and are often estimated using maximum likelihood techniques. Quantities of biological or management interest (``derived quantities'') are then often calculated as nonlinear functions of fixed and random effect estimates. However, the conventional ``plug-in'' estimator for a derived quantity in a maximum likelihood mixed-effects model will be biased whenever the estimator is calculated as a nonlinear function of random effects. We therefore describe and evaluate a new ``epsilon'' estimator as a generic bias-correction estimator for derived quantities. We use simulated data to compare the epsilon-method with an existing bias-correction algorithm for estimating recruitment in four configurations of an age-structured population dynamics model. This simulation experiment shows that the epsilon-method and the existing bias-correction method perform equally well in data-rich contexts, but the epsilon-method is slightly less biased in data-poor contexts. We then apply the epsilon-method to a spatial regression model when estimating an index of population abundance, and compare results with an alternative bias-correction algorithm that involves Markov-chain Monte Carlo sampling. This example shows that the epsilon-method leads to a biologically significant difference in estimates of average abundance relative to the conventional plug-in estimator, and also gives essentially identical estimates to a sample-based bias-correction estimator. The epsilon-method has been implemented by us as a generic option in the open-source Template Model Builder software, and could be adapted within other mixedeffects modeling tools such as Automatic Differentiation Model Builder for random effects. It therefore has potential to improve estimation performance for mixed-effects models throughout fisheries science. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Oceanographic processes and ecological interactions can strongly influence recruitment success in marine fishes. Here, we develop an environmental index of sablefish recruitment with the goal of elucidating recruitment-environment relationships and informing stock assessment. We start with a conceptual life-history model for sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria on the US west coast to generate stage- and spatio-temporally-specific hypotheses regarding the oceanographic and biological variables likely influencing sablefish recruitment. Our model includes seven stages from pre-spawn female condition through benthic recruitment (age-0 fish) for the northern portion of the west coast U.S. sablefish stock (40\textdegree N\textendash 50\textdegree N). We then fit linear models and use model comparison to select predictors. We use residuals from the stock-recruitment relationship in the 2015 sablefish assessment as the dependent variable (thus removing the effect of spawning stock biomass). Predictor variables were drawn primarily from ROMS model outputs for the California Current Ecosystem. We also include indices of prey and predator abundance and freshwater input. Five variables explained 57\% of the variation in recruitment not accounted for by the stock-recruitment relationship in the sablefish assessment. Recruitment deviations were positively correlated with (i) colder conditions during the spawner preconditioning period, (ii) warmer water temperatures during the egg stage, (iii) stronger cross-shelf transport to near-shore nursery habitats during the egg stage, (iv) stronger long-shore transport to the north during the yolk-sac stage, and (v) cold surface water temperatures during the larval stage. This result suggests that multiple mechanisms likely affect sablefish recruitment at different points in their life history.},

Such predictions present opportunities for improved LMR management and industry operations, as well as new research avenues in fisheries science. LMRs respond to climate variability via changes in physiology and behavior. For species and systems where climate-fisheries links are well established, forecasted LMR responses can lead to anticipatory and more effective decisions, benefitting both managers and stakeholders. Here, we provide an overview of climate prediction systems and advances in seasonal to decadal prediction of marine-resource relevant environmental variables. We then describe a range of climate-sensitive LMR decisions that can be taken at lead-times of months to decades, before highlighting a range of pioneering case studies using climate predictions to inform LMR decisions. The success of these case studies suggests that many additional applications are possible. Progress, however, is limited by observational and modeling challenges. Priority developments include strengthening of the mechanistic linkages between climate and marine resource responses, development of LMR models able to explicitly represent such responses, integration of climate driven LMR dynamics in the multi-driver context within which marine resources exist, and improved prediction of ecosystem-relevant variables at the fine regional scales at which most marine resource decisions are made. While there are fundamental limits to predictability, continued advances in these areas have considerable potential to make LMR managers and industry decision more resilient to climate variability and help sustain valuable resources. Concerted dialog between scientists, LMR managers and industry is essential to realizing this potential.},

In some fisheries, prediction could be achieved more cheaply and reliably by direct monitoring programs such as precruitment surveys of year-class strengths. In others, prediction is unnecessary because of existing feedback tactics for regulation, or would be primarily valuable to particular industrial interest groups and hence should not necessarily be subsidized by public research investment.

  abstract = {Age-structured production models (ASPMs) are often preferred over biomass aggregated surplus production models (SPMs) as the former can track the propagation of cohorts and explicitly account for the effects of selective fishing, even in the absence of reliable size- or age data. Here, we introduce `JABBA-Select', an extension of the JABBA software (Just Another Bayesian Biomass Assessment; Winker et al., 2018), that is able to overcome some of the shortcomings of conventional SPMs and allows a direct comparison to ASPMs. JABBASelect incorporates life history parameters and fishing selectivity and distinguishes between exploitable biomass (used to fit indices given fishery selectivity) and spawning biomass (used to predict surplus production). Applying JABBA-Select involves using an age-structured equilibrium model to convert the input parameters into multivariate normal priors for surplus-production productivity parameters. We illustrate the main elements of JABBA-Select using the stock parameters of South African silver kob (Argyrosomus inodorus, Scienidae) as a case study. This species is exploited by multiple fisheries and was selected as an example of a data moderate fishery that features strong contrast in selectivity over time and across fleets. For proof-of-concept, we use an agestructured simulation framework to compare the performance of JABBA-Select to: 1) a conventional Bayesian state-space model using a Pella-Tomlinson (PT) production function, 2) an ASPM with deterministic recruitment; and 3) an ASPM with stochastic recruitment. The PT model produced biased estimates of relative and absolute spawning biomass trajectories and associated reference points, which by contrast could be fairly accurately estimated by JABBA-Select. JABBA-Select performed at least as well as the ASPMs in accuracy for most of the performance metrics and best characterized the stock status uncertainty. The results indicate that JABBA-Select is able to accurately account for moderate changes in selectivity and fleet dynamics over time and to provide a robust tool for data-moderate stock assessments.},

  abstract = {The justification for incorporating environmental effects into fisheries stock assessment models has been investigated and debated for a long time. Recently, a state-space age-structured assessment model which includes the stochastic change in the environmental covariate over time and its effect on recruitment was developed for Southern New England-Mid Atlantic yellowtail flounder (Limanda ferruginea). In this paper, we first investigated the correlations of environmental covariates with Southern New England-Mid Atlantic yellowtail flounder recruitment deviations. The covariate that was most strongly correlated with the recruitment deviations was then incorporated into the state-space model and alternative effects on the stock-recruit relationship were estimated and compared. For the model that performed best as measured by Akaike information criterion, we also compared the estimates and predictions of various population attributes and biological reference points with those from an otherwise identical model without the environmental covariate in the stock-recruit function. We found that the estimates of population parameters are similar for the two models but the predictions differed substantially. To evaluate which model provided more reliable predictions, we quantitatively compared the prediction skill of the two models by generating two series of retrospective predictions. Comparison of the retrospective prediction pattern suggested that from an average point of view, the environmentally explicit model can provide more accurate near-term recruitment predictions especially the one year ahead recruitment prediction. However, the accuracy of the near-term recruitment prediction from the environmentally explicit model was largely determined by the accuracy of the corresponding environment prediction the model provides.},

  abstract = {How to properly weight composition data is an important ongoing research topic for fisheries stock assessments, and multiple methods for weighting composition data have been developed. Although several studies indicated that properly accounting for time-varying selectivity can reduce estimation biases in population biomass and management-related quantities, no study to date has compared the performance of widely used data-weighting methods when allowing for time-varying selectivity. Here, we conducted four simulation experiments on this topic, aiming to provide guidance on weighting age-composition data given time-varying selectivity. The first simulation experiment showed that over-weighting should be avoided in general and even when estimating time-varying selectivity. The second simulation experiment compared three data-weighting methods (McAllister\textendash Ianelli, Francis, and Dirichlet-multinomial), within which the Dirichlet-multinomial method outperformed the other two methods when selectivity is time-varying. The third and fourth simulation experiments further showed that given time-varying selectivity, the Dirichletmultinomial method still performed well when age-composition data were over-dispersed and when the level of selectivity variation needed to be simultaneously estimated. Our simulation results support using the Dirichlet-multinomial method when estimating time-varying fishery selectivity. Also, the simulations suggest that improving stock assessments by accounting for time-varying selectivity requires simultaneously addressing data weighting and time-varying selectivity.},
